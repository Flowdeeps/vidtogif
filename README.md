# vidtogif

A simple shell script I wrote to learn more about creating command line tools. It works by converting video to images using ffmpeg and then converting the images to an animated gif with imagemagick.

TL;DR

`vid2gif -w 600 -r 5 ./screencast.mov ./output.gif`

Here's an example of a gif created with the command above:
